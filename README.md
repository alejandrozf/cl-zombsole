# cl-zombsole
### _Alejandro Zamora <ale2014.zamora@gmail.com>_

Port of zombsole (https://github.com/fisadev/zombsole) to Common Lisp.

It was a lot of fun to me to port it because you can play programming, maybe it can be fun to other Lispers too :)

See the README of the original game to see more documentation.

Here you can create players but also modify the game in live thanks to CL!

If you pass the argument "-y" it will starts an Slynk server (0.0.0.0:4006) so you can start a REPL and do whatever you want.

The same with "-w" with will start a Swank server (0.0.0.0:4005)

See 'run.lisp' file for some examples

You can add more players, maps, rules, etc. See the folder 'maps' & the files 'players.lisp' and 'cl-zombsole.lisp'
